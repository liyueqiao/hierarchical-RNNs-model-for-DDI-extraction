Hierarchical RNNs model-based DDI extraction
=============================================

Hierarchical RNNs model-based DDI extraction aims to detect and classify the drug-drug interaction in biomedical texts, which has been the state-of-the-art methods for DDI extraction task. 

In this project, we will provide our implementations of Hierarchical RNNs model and DDI extraction 2013 corpus. It is developed with Keras 1.0.2 and python 2.7.

The details of related files are described as follows:

DDIextraction2013: the folder that contains the DDIextraction 2013 corpora including train data and test data. If you are intrested in the DDI extaction task, you can find more information about the DDIextraction 2013 and 2011 from http://labda.inf.uc3m.es/doku.php?id=en:labda_ddicorpus.

PreprocessData:	the folder that contains three pkl files including train.pkl.gz, test.pkl.gz and vec.pkl.gz,respectively.

Note that the relative paper and the source code have been submitted to review. After the review process, we will upload the source code in this project.
